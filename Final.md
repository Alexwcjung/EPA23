# ðŸ“š**Final project: Pronunciation Curriculum Development**

## **Objective:** 
- Create a pronunciation-focused curriculum tailored to a specific group of English learners (beginners, intermediate, or advanced).
- 

## **â™’Instructions:**

1. **Target group:** 1st grade Vocational High school students whos English level is beginners. They are 17 years old, native speakers of Korean language, and had little English education. Their interest level in English is low. 

2. **Curriculum duration:** Considering that the target group has low level of interest and proficiency of English, a semester, 20 weeks, should be appropriate for the students to make measurable progress.

3. **Set learning objectives:** Clearly outline the pronunciation learning objectives for your target group. Consider both segmental (phonemes) and suprasegmental (stress, intonation, rhythm) aspects of pronunciation. Develop goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

4. **Create lesson a sample plan:** Develop one or two mini activies for one of the lessons, including the following components:

+ a. Lesson objectives
+ b. Warm-up activities: processes needed to be detailed.
+ c. Instructional materials and methods (e.g., book chapters, Praat exercises, AI tools, etc.)
+ d. Practice activities (pair work, group work, individual tasks)
+ e. Assessment and feedback methods (formative and summative)
+ f. Homework assignments
+ g. Extra resources for further practice or self-study (e.g., perception training using Praat MFC)

5. **Incorporate technology:** Integrate Praat and AI tools into your lesson plans, using them to supplement instruction, facilitate practice, and assess learners' pronunciation progress. Provide a rationale for your choice of tools and how they enhance the learning experience.

6. **Design assessments:** Develop a variety of assessment methods to evaluate learners' progress, including informal classroom assessments (e.g., observation, oral quizzes) and formal assessments (e.g., exams, presentations, or recordings analyzed with Praat or AI tools). Provide clear rubrics for evaluation.

7. **Create a teacher's guide:** Compile all lesson plans, materials, and assessment tools into a comprehensive teacher's guide, ensuring that it is user-friendly, well-organized, and visually appealing.

8. **Reflect on your curriculum (1 page in pdf format):** Write a reflection on your curriculum development process, discussing the challenges and successes you encountered, the rationale behind your choices, and any suggestions for improvement or adaptation in different teaching contexts. ðŸš©[Submit here](https://forms.gle/yfH3Wt3QSdHpuHPk7)
