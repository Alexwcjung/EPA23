## üçÉ Course Description
This course will explore English pronunciation learning for foreign language learners. Topics will include the description and articulation of sounds of English, segmental (phoneme) aspects, and suprasegmental (stress, intonation, rhythm) aspects of English pronunciation. Learning about places and manners of articulation will help students notice how English sounds differ from their native language. Additionally, students will be provided with ample opportunities to practice English sounds using digital resources, which will enable them to visualize and analyze their speech patterns. A variety of exposure to authentic materials, AI technologies, and online videos will help upgrade their speaking proficiency as well. By the end of the course, students will have developed a basic understanding of English sounds and be able to produce intelligible speech.

## üçÉ Course Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
+ Develop a basic knowledge of English sounds, including segmental (phoneme) and suprasegmental (stress, intonation, rhythm) aspects.
+ Develop an understanding of acoustic properties through spectrographic analysis and waveform analysis. 
+ Use a variety of methods and tools to practice and improve their pronunciation proficiency, and hence, their speech intelligibility.

## üçÉ Assessment
1. Formative assessment:
+ ‚úÖ Rubric: Your speech intonation should be as similar as possible to that of a native speaker. Each time your pitch curve on Praat shows the opposite direction of that of a native speaker, three points will be deducted.
+ ‚úÖ Feedback: The image of your pitch wave will be compared with that of the native speaker on TTS. The differences will be marked and posted on Padlet.
  
2. Summative assessment:
+ Step 1: Choose seven words that Koreans often add one or more vowels to (e.g., site, cake).
+ Step 2: Record on Praat. When pronouncing a word, you must (1) pronounce the word with vowel insertion and (2) pronounce it without vowel insertion. You should aim to show the difference between (1) and (2) as clearly as possible.
+ ‚úÖRubric: Each time you are judged to have added a vowel to a consonant in your waveform, two points will be deducted.
+ ‚úÖ Feedback: The image of your pitch wave will be compared with that of a native speaker. The difference will be marked and posted on Padlet.
