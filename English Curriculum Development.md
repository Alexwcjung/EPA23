## üçÉ Course Description
This course will explore English pronunciation learning for foreign language learners. Topics will include the description and articulation of sounds of English, segmental (phoneme) aspects, and suprasegmental (stress, intonation, rhythm) aspects of English pronunciation. Learning about places and manners of articulation will help students notice how English sounds differ from their native language. Additionally, students will be provided with ample opportunities to practice English sounds using digital resources, which will enable them to visualize and analyze their speech patterns. A variety of exposure to authentic materials, AI technologies, and online videos will help upgrade their speaking proficiency as well. By the end of the course, students will have developed a basic understanding of English sounds and be able to produce intelligible speech.

## üçÉ Course Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
+ Develop a foundational understanding of English sounds, encompassing both segmental (phoneme) and suprasegmental (stress, intonation, rhythm) aspects.
+ Acquire knowledge of acoustic properties by conducting spectrographic analysis and waveform analysis.
+ Employ various methods and tools to practice and enhance their pronunciation skills, thereby improving their speech intelligibility.

## üçÉ Assessment
1. Formative Assessment:
+ ‚úÖ Rubric: Your speech intonation should closely resemble that of a native speaker. For each instance where your pitch curve on Praat shows the opposite direction of that of a native speaker, three points will be deducted.
+ ‚úÖ Feedback: The image of your pitch wave will be compared with that of the native speaker on TTS. Differences will be identified and posted on Padlet for your reference.

2. Summative Assessment:
+ Step 1: Select seven words commonly prone to vowel insertion by Korean speakers (e.g., site, cake).
+ Step 2: Utilize Praat to record your pronunciation. When pronouncing each word, you should (1) pronounce it with vowel insertion and (2) pronounce it without vowel insertion. Aim to demonstrate the difference between (1) and (2) as distinctly as possible.
+ ‚úÖ Rubric: For each instance where it is determined that you added a vowel to a consonant in your waveform, two points will be deducted.
+ ‚úÖ Feedback: The image of your pitch wave will be compared with that of a native speaker. Discrepancies will be identified, marked, and posted on Padlet for your review.
