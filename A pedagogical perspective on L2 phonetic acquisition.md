# A pedagogical perspective on L2 phonetic acquisition
**Instruction**
+ Purcell and Suter concluded that L2 pronunciation were beyond the control of L2 teachers.
+ That interpretation hastened a movement away from the teaching of pronunciation that had already bgun by the 1970s.
+ The Audiolingual Method of language instruction had, up till that time, held sway in language classrooms.
+ The Audiolingual instruction began to disappear and Stephen Krashen's Input Hypothesis emerged.
+ **Krashen's theory emerged when Communicative Language Teaching(CLT) movement was gaining currency.**
+ CLT classroom activities were guided by the notion that learners would acquire the necessary aspects of language, including pronunciation through opportunities to communicate.
+ 
+ **"Two problems with Purcell and Suter study"**
     1. The only dependent variable they considered was the strength of foreign accent. They did not consider speech intelligibility, comprehensibility, fluency, or any fine-grained detailes of their subject's oral productions.
  2. The study is a correlational investigation, rather than a systematically designed experimental study. Correlational studies permit only relatively weak conclusions and disallow causal interpretations. The study, therefore, does not allow us to conclude that instruction is ineffective.
