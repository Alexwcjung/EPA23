# A pedagogical perspective on L2 phonetic acquisition

**A CLOSER LOOK: Aptitude for pronunciation** 
+ Hu et al.(2013) examined in detail the factors contributing to pronunciation aptitude.
+ The study consists of two parts, one a behavioural evaluation and the other an examination of brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI)
+ For the behavioural component, each speaker recorded an oral reading of a passage and the recordings were rated by 10 listeners. 
+ The independent(predictor) varialbes consisted of scores on tests of phonetic coding ablitiy, phonological working memory, musical aptitude, verbal and non-verbal IQ, and personality traits. The analysis revealed that phonetic coding ability together with empathy predicted the pronunciation ratings moderately well, with no other significant predictors.
+ The fMRI portion of the study revealed that the brain activity in the better pronouncers differed from that of the poorer pronouncers.

**Instruction**
+ Purcell and Suter concluded that L2 pronunciation were beyond the control of L2 teachers.
+ That interpretation hastened a movement away from the teaching of pronunciation that had already bgun by the 1970s.
+ The Audiolingual Method of language instruction had, up till that time, held sway in language classrooms.
+ The Audiolingual instruction began to disappear and Stephen Krashen's Input Hypothesis emerged.
+ **Krashen's theory emerged when Communicative Language Teaching(CLT) movement was gaining currency.**
+ CLT classroom activities were guided by the notion that learners would acquire the necessary aspects of language, including pronunciation through opportunities to communicate.
+ **"Two problems with Purcell and Suter study"**
     1. The only dependent variable they considered was the strength of foreign accent. They did not consider speech intelligibility, comprehensibility, fluency, or any fine-grained detailes of their subject's oral productions. **Some heavy accents can still be highly intelligible**
  2. The study is a correlational investigation, rather than a systematically designed experimental study. Correlational studies permit only relatively weak conclusions and disallow causal interpretations. The study, therefore, does not allow us to conclude that instruction is ineffective. 
+ The most compelling evaluation of the benefits of instruction on pronunciation would be an experimental investigation in which subjects are randomly assigned to control(no instruction) and instruced conditions and tested prior to and after instruction period.
+ Even if some randomeness was involved, the subject group was actually a sample of convenience(i.e. a group of research participants selected on the basis of ready availability and willingness to cooperate).
+ At present we do not know of any true experimental studies of pronunciation instruction. However, several researchers have now published instances of the new best type: quasi-experimental investigations. These have used constrolled intervention without true random group assignment.

**Other influences**
+ Several other influences on pronunciation includes gender, Learning styles and personality. 
+ "ego permeability" 
     1. Those who drank a small amount of alcohol pronounced words better than did a control group.
     2. Students being deeply hypnotized scored better than who did not.

**Applying research findings in the pronunciation classroom**
+ Mounting evience converges in favor of the view that adult L2 pronunication is both leanable and teachable.

**Age**
+ Producing speech intelligibly is a far more relevant to L2 communication than is a preoccupation with sounding native-like.
+ We do not know what correlation exists between AOL and intelligibility.
+ Intelligible, comprehensible speech is not only possible in adult L2 learners.

**Language experience**
+ LOR is not a satisfactory measure of language experience. Rather, actual experience with the L2 is indeed benefical under the right circumstances.
+ Window of Maximal Opportunity 
     1. Adults learners seem most likely to improve in certain pronunication skills in the the absence of pronunication-specific instruction shortly after arrival in an L2 speaking area.
     2. Perhaps the limits on production improvement after a certain initail interval result from having repeatedly practiced non-nativelike articulatory patterns.

**Motivational influences**
+ Learners who seek out and exploit opportunities to use the L2 tend to advacne in terms of intelligibility and comprehensibility.

**Aptitude**
+ Perhaps future research will help us undertand how aptitude relates to the ability to acquire intelligible speech.
+ Until then, teachers should simply expect variability in learners' success in pronunciation and encourage their efforts to improve.

**Instruction**
+ We now know that a number of empirical research on pronunication was built on faulty evidence.

**Summary**
+ That well-known finding has proved misleading because it emphasizes what learnes cannot usually achieve(perfect pronunciation) rather than what they are capable of achieving(intelligible speech)
+ Teachers must remember that accent in itself is not the focus of communicative pronunciation instruction.
+ The validity of a critical period remians controversial. The variability appears to be due to a variety of influences that mediate age effects.
+ Learners who gain language experience by interacting regulary in their L2 tend to improve more.
+ Useful instructional strategies include encouraging students to use the L2 outside the classroom by initiating and sustaining interactions.
