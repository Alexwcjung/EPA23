# A pedagogical perspective on L2 phonetic acquisition
**Instruction**
+ Purcell and Suter concluded that L2 pronunciation were beyond the control of L2 teachers.
+ That interpretation hastened a movement away from the teaching of pronunciation that had already bgun by the 1970s.
+ The Audiolingual Method of language instruction had, up till that time, held sway in language classrooms.
+ The Audiolingual instruction began to disappear and Stephen Krashen's Input Hypothesis emerged.
+ **Krashen's theory emerged when Communicative Language Teaching(CLT) movement was gaining currency.**
+ CLT classroom activities were guided by the notion that learners would acquire the necessary aspects of language, including pronunciation through opportunities to communicate.
+ 
+ **"Two problems with Purcell and Suter study"**
     1. The only dependent variable they considered was the strength of foreign accent. They did not consider speech intelligibility, comprehensibility, fluency, or any fine-grained detailes of their subject's oral productions. **Some heavy accents can still be highly intelligible**
  2. The study is a correlational investigation, rather than a systematically designed experimental study. Correlational studies permit only relatively weak conclusions and disallow causal interpretations. The study, therefore, does not allow us to conclude that instruction is ineffective. 
+ The most compelling evaluation of the benefits of instruction on pronunciation would be an experimental investigation in which subjects are randomly assigned to control(no instruction) and instruced conditions and tested prior to and after instruction period.
+ Even if some randomeness was involved, the subject group was actually a sample of convenience(i.e. a group of research participants selected on the basis of ready availability and willingness to cooperate).
+ At present we do not know of any true experimental studies of pronunciation instruction. However, several researchers have now published instances of the new best type: quasi-experimental investigations. These have used constrolled intervention without true random group assignment.

**Other influences**
+ Several other influences on pronunciation includes gender, Learning styles and personality. 
+ "ego permeability" 
     1. Those who drank a small amount of alcohol pronounced words better than did a control group.
     2. Students being deeply hypnotized scored better than who did not.

**Applying research findings in the pronunciation classroom**
+ Mounting evience converges in favor of the view that adult L2 pronunication is both leanable and teachable.

**Age**
+ Producing speech intelligibly is a far more relevant to L2 communication than is a preoccupation with sounding native-like.
+ We do not know what correlation exists between AOL and intelligibility.
+ Intelligible, comprehensible speech is not only possible in adult L2 learners.
