# A pedagogical perspective on L2 phonetic acquisition
**Instruction**
+ Purcell and Suter concluded that L2 pronunciation were beyond the control of L2 teachers.
+ That interpretation hastened a movement away from the teaching of pronunciation that had already bgun by the 1970s.
+ The Audiolingual Method of language instruction had, up till that time, held sway in language classrooms.
+ The Audiolingual instruction began to disappear and Stephen Krashen's Input Hypothesis emerged.
+ **Krashen's theory emerged when Communicative Language Teaching(CLT) movement was gaining currency.**
+ CLT classroom activities were guided by the notion that learners would acquire the necessary aspects of language, including pronunciation through opportunities to communicate.
+ The strength of foreign accent should not be considered as the only dependent variables. Speech intelligibility, comprehensibility, or fluency should be.
+ **Some heavy accents can still be highly intelligible.
