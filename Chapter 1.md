# key concepts
+ Intelligibility 
  1. the most fundamental characteristic of successful oral communication. 
  2. We mean that listeners can understand the speaker's intended meaning.
  3. When intelligibility is low, interlocutors adjust their own language to help foster communication through a process known as Foreigner Talk.
  4. Having an accent can afford disadvantages to the L2 speakers including denied employment or refused accomodation.
 **If pronunciation patterns get in the way, action is essential. This book covers the concepts needed for understanding whys and hows of assistsing L2 speakers to develop more effective oral pronunciation skills**

- Segmentals : individual constants, vowels
- Suprasegmentals refers to those aspects of speech that are superimposed on the sequences of sounds that comprise words, phrases, and larger units.
- Prosody includes word and sentence stress, rhythm, intonation, juncture, and tone.

- comprehensibility : the amount of effort that must be put in to understanding speech.
- Fluency
  1. signalled by the presence of absence of hesitation markers, self-repetitions, and filled and unfilled pauses.
  2. the ability to express their ideas in novel ways, to pun, to make up jokes, to attend to the sound independently of the sense, to vary styles, to create and build on metaphors, and so on.
  3. simply the ability to talk at length with few pauses.
  4. Speakers who are slow talkers in their L1 are unlikely to be fast talkers in their L2, regardless of their proficiency level as a result of cognitive function.
+ Comprehensibility and intelligibility are more closely related to each other than they are to accent. That is, it is possiblie to be somewhat difficult to understand and yet to be fully intelligible ??

- Nativeness and intelligibility principles
  1. Vast majority of L2 leaners need only comfortable intelligibility. However, pedagogical practice has not always conformed to the Intelligibility Principle. During the Audiolingual Ara, great emphasis was placed on highly accurate pronunciation.
  2. few adults learners ever achieve native-like pronunciation in the L2.

- An evidence-based approach to pronunciation teaching and teaching materials
  1. Minimal pair practice : some contrasts are considerably more important than others.
- the effectiveness of segmental instruction versus suprasegmental instruction called for three conditions: a control group, which received no pronunciation instruction, a segmental group, which received insruction on consonants and vowels, and a suprasegmental group, which received prosodic instruction only. Only the suprasegmental group showed a significant improvement in comprehensibility and unrehearsed picture descriptions, although both instructed groups improved on sentences that they read aloud.
  1. both segments and suprasegmentals have a place in the L2 pronunciation classroom.

** Intelligibility and comprehensibility should be priorities but it is important that teachers be flexiblie in accomodating students' needs and wishes. The question of whether to teach English interdental Fricatives often comes up, given that they are not very important to either intelligibility or comprehensibility even though they are a sailent feature of accent.**
