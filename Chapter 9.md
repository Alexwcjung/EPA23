# ‚ú®Assessing Second Language Pronunciation: Distinguishing Features of Rhythm in Learner Speech at Different Proficiency Levels

üçÄ**Introduction**
-	While pronunciation is clearly an important skill, and insufficient pronunciation ability is detrimental to the intelligibility of speech, it has a surprisingly **minor role in theoretical L2 models**, in assessment scales of speaking, and in practical assessment and teaching contexts involving examiners, teachers and learners.
-	**The backstage role of pronunciation** in theoretical models is also reflected in some well-known assessment scales, where pronunciation tends to be captured inconsistently or to be entirely absent. 
-	For example, the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines for Speaking (ACTFL, 2012) **do not** include descriptors for pronunciation at every level.
-	This is because of **the difficulty** in distinguishing across pronunciation ability levels in the same way as other language skills and the difficulty in interpreting descriptors of pronunciation consistently across languages.
-	**The underdeveloped nature of the pronunciation construct** is also seen in the challenge presented by pronunciation for teachers and examiners: studies have indicated that examiners find the assessment of pronunciation to be more challenging than that of other skills.
-	Teachers have been found to lack training and confidence in their pronunciation expertise (Levis, 2006)
-	The study aims to **establish a profile** of the rhythmic properties of learner speech at different proficiency levels, which can in turn contribute towards a more comprehensive definition and operationalization of the construct of L2 pronunciation.
-	A broader aim is to raise awareness about micro-level features of rhythm and prosody which play a role in learner speech, and which teachers and assessors are likely to benefit from.

üçÄ**Role of Rhythm in English Speech** 
-	Rhythm has traditionally been seen as **a key distinguishing feature between languages**, with stress-timed and syllable-time languages. 
-	------
1. In stress-timed languages 
 + The durations between each stressed syllable tend to be approximately equal.
 + Stressed syllables are significantly longer than unstressed syllables and unstressed syllables which occur between consecutive stressed syllables are compressed (e.g. through vowel reduction) to fit into the time interval. 
2. In syllable-timed languages
- The durations of syllables tend to be equal.
- Syllables have more equal duration and prominence, with little or no vowel reduction.
----------
-	A summary of key properties is provided in Table 9.1

-	Although the rhythmic distinctions between stress-timed and syllable-timed languages have been empirically supported, **many instrumental studies have failed** to find constant and systematic evidence to support the dichotomous approach to categorizing languages. 
-	**Rather than categorizing languages in terms of two distinct rhythm classes**, crosslinguistic differences in rhythm are now accounted for **in terms of a continuous model of rhythm in which a combination of language-specific properties** (besides more general factors such as speaking rate) result in different rhythmic patterning gradients along a continuum.
-	As figure 9.1 shows, syllable boundaries do not necessarily coincide with the edges of words (e.g. in ‚Äòif you‚Äô the /f/ forms a syllable with the following word /ju:/), nor with the intervals that contain the sequences of vocalic or consonantal material (e.g. in ‚Äòstrictly‚Äô, the second consonantal interval straddles a syllable boundary). 
-	The figure also illustrates that the intervals are delimited by major phrase boundaries (marked by a silent pause # in this example). 
-	The effect of syllable structure can be seen when we compare intervals that contain complex consonant clusters (e.g. /str/ in ‚Äòstrictly‚Äô) with those that contain singleton consonants (e.g. /t/ in ‚Äòteam‚Äô).
-	Accented syllables with full vowels tend to be considerably longer than unaccented syllables which often contain reduced vowels (e.g. /I/ in ‚Äòstrict‚Äô, ‚Äòif‚Äô and ‚Äò-ly‚Äô).

üçÄ**Rhythm Metrics**
-	A number of metrics have been developed to **_quantify rhythm in (learner) speech_** %V (Proportion of vocalic material in speech)
-	The proportion of the vocalic interval duration in speech is expressed as a percentage from the total utterance duration: %V (i.e. comparing the amount of material in the grey against the striped boxes in Figure 9.1).
-	In a stressed-timed language such as English, %V would typically be lower due to vowel reduction and to the presence of consonant clusters, compared to syllable-timed languages such as Spanish. 

üçÄ**Varco-V and Varco-C (variability in vocalic or consonantal duration)**
-	To measure the variability in vocalic or consonantal interval duration, Dellwo developed Varco-C, **which calculates the standard deviation of consonantal interval duration** (normalized for speech rate) as well as **vocalic counterpart Varco-V.**
-	Typically, **this variability is expected to be larger** in syllable structures associated with **a stress-timed language**(e.g. some syllables have complex consonant clusters and some simple structures) and greater accentual and final lengthening. 
-	**In syllable-timed language**, in contrast, a large proportion of syllables have **a simple CV structure** and successive syllables are more similar in length, leading to **lower variability values.**
PVI (Pairwise Variability Index)
-	Other measures capture rhythm more locally by focusing on the degree of **durational difference between neighboring intervals.**
-	PVI metric calculates the mean of the durational differences between successive temporal intervals in an intonation phrase. 
-	**A stress-timed language** would be expected to have **high PVI values, a syllable-timed language low PVI values.**

üçÄ**Prosody, Rhythm and Second Language English Learners**
-	**Stress**- the most widely studied prosodic feature in L2 speech ‚Äì has consistently been found to relate to L2 comprehensibility, both at word- and sentence-stress level.
-	Low (2006) suggests that **the rhythm of a stress-timed language would be more difficult to acquire** than the rhythm of a syllable-timed language, due to the need to **reduce vowels** and **compress syllables in stress-timed languages.**  
-	**Vowel reduction** ‚Äì a fundamental component of rhythm in English ‚Äì has been related to measures and perceptions of accentedness and comprehensibility in learners. 
-	The authors reported **high correlations between rhythm and proficiency level** measured by TOEFL iBT speaking test 
-	Praat was used alongside listener coding of measures to analyze objective pronunciation measures, such as proportion of words with prominent stress, number of prominent syllables per run, overall pitch range and a range of tones. The finding indicated that **there are objectively measured differences between high- and low-proficiency learners, but not necessarily between adjacent levels.**
-	**As proficiency increased, the proportion of stressed words within a sentence decreased**, thus supporting prior research indicating that low-proficiency leaners stress items regardless of their function or importance. 

üçÄ**Study Aim and Research Questions**
-	Few studies have systematically examined **how rhythm is displayed by L2 learners at different proficiency levels and from controlled L2 backgrounds.** 
-	The aim of this study, therefore, is to offer **a more comprehensive empirically based investigation of rhythm in L2 speech** than that given in previous studies in order to establish to what extent rhythmic measures can discriminate between proficiency levels.
-	We do so through a small-scale quantitative investigation of objectively measureable micro-level prosodic rhythmic features in the speech of learners at different proficiency levels and controlling for learner L2 background.
-	A broader aim of the study is to contribute a cross-disciplinary perspective to L2 pronunciation through collaboration between L2 phoneticians and language assessment specialists.
-	The following four research questions guide the study; the first two deal with **pronunciation across proficiency levels** while the last two deal with **pronunciation across L1s.**
1)	How reliably can levels of L2 pronunciation ability be discriminated across CEFR Levels A1-C2 using a set of rhythmic measures? 
2)	Which rhythmic measures have the highest discriminative properties for particular proficiency levels?
3)	How far do rhythmic measures display different patterns for learners of different L1 backgrounds?
4)	Which rhythmic measures display the largest differences for particular L1s?
