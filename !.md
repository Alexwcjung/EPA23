## üçÉ Course Description
This course will explore English pronunciation learning for foreign language learners. Topics will include description and articulation of sounds of English, segmental (phoneme) aspects, and suprasegmental (stress, intonation, rhythm) aspects of English pronunciation. Through the description and articulation of sounds of English, students will learn places and manners of articulation, which will help notice the difference between English sounds and their native language. Students will be provided with ample opportunity to practice English sounds using digital resources, they can visualize and analyze their speech patterns which will contribute to their pronunciation improvement. They will also have a plentiful opportunities to upgrade their speaking proficiency by the exposure to athentic materials, AI technologies, and online videos. By the end of the course, students will have developed a basic understanding of English sounds and be able to produce intellgible speech.

## üçÉ Course objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to
+ Develop a basic knowledge of speech produnction especially segmental and suprasegmental aspects.
+ Develop an understanding of acoustic properties in a form of spectrographic analysis and waveform analysis.
+ Use automated speech tools, AI tools to practice and improve their pronunciation and hence their speech intelligibility.

## üçÉ Assessment
1. Formative assessment  
+ ‚úÖ Rubric : Your speech intonation has to be as similar as that of native speaker possible. If your pitch curve on Praat is opposite that of native speaker, three points will be deducted each curve.
+ ‚úÖ Feedback : The image of your pitch wave will be compared with that of the native speaker on TTS. The differences will be marked and posted on Padlet
2. Summative assessment
+ Step 1. Choose 7 words that Koreans often add one or more vowels to a word (i.e., site, cake).
+ Step 2. Record on Praat. When pronouncing a word, you must (1) pronounce a word with vowel insertion and (2) without vowel insertion. You must show the difference between (1) and (2) as much as you can.
+ ‚úÖ Rubric : Each time you are judged to have added a vowel to a consonant in your waveform, 2 points will be deducted.
+ ‚úÖ Feedback : The image of your pitch wave will be compared with that of native speaker. The difference will be marked and posted on Padlet
