## üçÉ Course Description
This course will explore English pronunciation learning for foreign language learners. Topics will include description and articulation of sounds of English, segmental (phoneme) aspects, and suprasegmental (stress, intonation, rhythm) aspects of English pronunciation. In this course, students will have the opportunity to improve their pronunciation and hence their speech intelligibility. Students will also have the chance to visualize and analyze their speech patterns via automated speech tools that can assist in learning. Students will have ample opportunities to practice and improve their pronunciation and also have introductory understanding of English phonetics.

## üçÉ Course objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to
+ Develop a basic knowledge of speech produnction especially segmental and suprasegmental aspects.
+ Develop an understanding of acoustic properties in a form of spectrographic analysis and waveform analysis.
+ Use automated speech tools, AI tools to practice and improve their pronunciation and hence their speech intelligibility.
