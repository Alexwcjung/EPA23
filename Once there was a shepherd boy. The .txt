Once there was a shepherd boy. The boy kept a flock of sheep near a forest. It was not far from his village. 
One day, the boy wanted to make fun with the villagers. So, he began to shout, “Wolf! Wolf! Help me! Help me!” 
The villagers near this forest heard his crying and came to help him. When they came near the boy, they found no wolf there and the boy laughed at them. 
The villagers were fooled by the cunning boy and they went away.
After a few days, he made the same fun again and the villagers came again to help him. 
But found no wolf there this time too. One day, suddenly a wolf really came and it attacked the flock of sheep. 
The boy somehow climbed up a tree. Then he started shouting for help. The villagers heard his shouting but they thought that it was his other fun. 
So, no one came to help him, The wolf killed one of his sheep and took it away. 
The boy felt very sorry for his silly joke. From then, he promised not to tell a lie and befool people again.
